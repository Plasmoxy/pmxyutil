# pmxy-util

In this repo you can find all of my Linux utility programs that I made and have them in bin folder.

<h2>BIGGER PROJECTS</h2>
* radiotroll - a tool to easily connect to secured/open wifi through terminal
    * ( uses wpa_supplicant.conf )
    * -> working on /etc/network/interfaces functionality too

<h2>SIMPLE UTILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE USEFUL</h2>
* _chex - just a quick sudo chmod 777
* c - clear
* cputemp - [IN PROGRESS] a temperature monitor for RaspberryPi
* cus - just a sudo shutdown now
* sthmchi - start hamachi
